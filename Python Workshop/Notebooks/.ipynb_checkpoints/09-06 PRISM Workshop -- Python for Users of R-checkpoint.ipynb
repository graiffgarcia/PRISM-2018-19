    "# PRISM Workshop: Python for R Users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0: Why use Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very powerful language with a large and active developer community (last year, [Python overtook Java as the 2nd most popular language on GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/#build)), a very elegant and logical syntax, and a number of popular third-party packages for data analysis. The Python philosophy is that the language should provide *one* way to perform a task, and that one way should make sense. This goal is what the community that maintains and updates the Python language strives for, and it really shows (in my opinion).\n",
    "\n",
    "But Python also offers flexibility: unlike Java, which tries to force you to adopt an object-oriented approach to everything you do, Python gives you choice. Your programs don't have to be [noun-dominated](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's third-party packages allow you to perform tasks that you just can't in R (like webscraping, with Selenium and BeautifulSoup4), that would be too cumbersome in R (like agent-based modeling, with Mesa), or that are way slower in R (like machine learning, with scikit-learn).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.0. Python 2 or Python 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, you won't be able to tell the difference most of the time. Some packages no longer support Python 2 (like `rpy2`, which I use in this file to run R code in a Python notebook), so Python 3 is recommended. The code here is in Python 2, but there's also a Python 3 version. The code is *exactly* the same, except for four main differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Division: Python 3 allows you to divide two integers and get a float\n",
    "* The `print()` function\n",
    "* The section on formatting strings (with `%s` vs. `format()` vs. f-Strings)\n",
    "* The `iteritems()` method for dicts, which is deprecated in Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 has been a viable option since 2017 or so (when package developers started dropping support for Python 2.7). I recommend switching to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1. Installing and running python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a Mac, good news: it comes with Python 2! You can start a Python session by opening the Terminal, typing \"python\", and pressing return. I *strongly* recommend installing Python again, though, because the default Python 2 installation doesn't allow you to update packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installers of Python for both Mac and Windows can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you install Python, you can open a Terminal/Powershell window and type `python` to start a Python shell session. You can create Python scripts on any text editor (I use Sublime Text; Visual Studio Code is a great free alternative) and run them in Terminal/Powershell with `python my_script.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2. Whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "R allows you to write a monstrosity like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "for(i in 1:5){x[i]<-i^2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, indentation is part of Python's syntax. The *body* of loops and function definitions have to be *indented* by two tabs or four spaces. This is part of the language's philosophy: simple is better than complex; readability counts. Using whitespace is better than counting parentheses and brackets at the ends of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1: What's our goal today?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's impossible to cover all the bases in 90 minutes, but it's very possible to help you make sense of things so you can have a solid foundation to build on. In that spirit, I hope I can show you how Python differs from R, both syntactically and logically, so that you can translate your knowledge of one language to another painlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is that, after leaving this workshop and maybe re-reading this script a couple times, you will be able to teach yourself anything you need to know in Python by:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) leveraging your knowledge of R;\n",
    "\n",
    "b) tinkering, the most important skill in programming;\n",
    "\n",
    "c) reading the manuals and documentation for Python modules;\n",
    "\n",
    "d) confidently working your way through self-teaching manuals, like the excellent Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw."

A module is analogous to an R package -- when you import one, you can access all its functions and objects. A \"package\" is a directory that contains one or more modules. Usually, even when you want to install a single module, it comes \"packaged\": the module will be installed in a folder, with the relevant `.py` file. In Pythonland, people usually talk about installing packages and importing modules, and this is why.\n",

To install multiple packages at once, you enter all their names separated by spaces. For example, to install every package that we're going to use today, you'd enter `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Loading modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed a package, you may import its modules to your scripts in two different ways: some packages only consist of one module, which you load with `import [module]`. Packages that have more than one module allow you to load individual modules with `from [package] import [module]`. You can also do that to load a specific class from a module: `from [module] import [class]`. \n",
